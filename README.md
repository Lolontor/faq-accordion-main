## My process
First, I statred with the structing of my accordion page with html5 
I followed with styling with CSS3 to get enough styled page to add the button functionality
I then used JavaScript to add the click event to the accordion sections.
Then finally I finished up with completing the rest of the styling of the accordion.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript


### What I learned
During this challenge, I really learnt a lot. I was able to use JavaScript on my website to change to appearance of a paricular section when the user click on a question. Also I was able to notice that my Javascript fundamentals needed more attention. I learnt I am not ready to take on JavaScript included challanges yet.


### Continued development

- JavaScript fundamentals.
- JavaScript for frontend development.
